## StoryOfTheProject:

A little over a year ago I created my first slot machine project. I didn't know what a reel was yet. In this project, I will refactor and clean up the previous one to reflect the new knowledge gained about working with TYPESCRIPT, PIXI.JS, GSAP, HTML, CSS and other technologies learned. In this way, I will be able to make a comparison of my development in this year and something, since the creation of the first project.

## GameDescription:

FLOWERS LUCK is a slot machine with three reels, and each reel includes three symbols. There are eight types of basic symbols and one wild symbol. The mechanics of disbursing funds will be worked out later.

## Commands:

-   `npm run build` - starts build procedure
-   `npm run dev` - starts build and run local server
